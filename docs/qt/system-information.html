    <h2 id="os-information">Os Information</h2>
    <p>
        This group contains the Operating System information. More specifically:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            Category
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The general category of the operating system, for instance 'Linux', 'Windows' etc.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Name
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The name of the operating system, for instance 'Ubuntu', 'Windows 10' etc.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Version
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The version of the operating system, for instance '6.11.0', '2004' etc.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="memory-information">Memory Information</h2>
    <p>
        This group contains the main memory (RAM) information. More specifically:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            Total size
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The main memory size in IEC units.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Page size
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The page size that is used in IEC units.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Version
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The version of the operating system, for instance '6.11.0', '2004' etc.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="cpu-information">CPU Information</h2>
    <p>
        This group contains the CPU information. More specifically:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            Architecture
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The CPU architecture used by Elpida. Note that this does not imply the CPU architecture is this. For
            instance, you can run the 'i686' version of Elpida on an 'x86-64' cpu, but Elpida will report 'i686' as
            architecture.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Vendor
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The CPU vendor name.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Model name
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The CPU model name.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="timing-information">Timing information</h2>
    <p>
        This group contains information about timings calculated by Elpida. These timing are used by elpida to precisely
        calculate
        time for benchmarks. More specifically:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            now() overhead
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The average time a call to 'now()' takes on this machine. 'now()' returns a precise time-point.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Loop overhead
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The average time an empty loop takes.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            B. Ips
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Or Bogus instructions per second. This is directly related to 'Loop overhead' and it is the rate of empty
            loops
            that the system can run.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="topology">Topology</h2>
    <p>
        This is the topology of the system. This graph describes the cpu cores/caches/packages structure tree and sizes
        of each node.
        From here you can select which cores/threads the custom benchmarks will use. You can select/deselect
        cores/threads by clicking
        on them or by massively select them by clicking an ancestor group (for instance clicking on the LD2 cache name
        will select all
        cores/threads inside that cache).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Numbers in parentheses (e.g. '(2)'), is the id/index the operating system gave to this node.</li>
        <li>Numbers with a 'iB' (e.g. '32 KiB') suffix is the size of the node in bytes in case the node has memory.
        </li>
        <li>Numbers in brackets (e.g. '[1]') is the efficiency this specific core reports. This number makes sense when
            the cpu
            has not a standard size of cores, for instance big.LITTLE cpus.
