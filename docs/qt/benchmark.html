<h1>Benchmark</h1>
<p>
    This tab is about general benchmarking your CPU. This will run a batch of pre-configured benchmarks to determine its
    speed compared to other CPUs on the same benchmarks.
</p>
<h2>Score</h2>
<p>This group shows the scores for the most recent benchmark run in this session.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first number with the large letters is the total score. Next to it is the difference with the previous
        run.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Single thread</strong>: The single thread score for the latest run. Next to it is the difference with
        the previous run.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Multi thread</strong>: The multi thread score for the latest run. Next to it is the difference with the
        previous run.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>This group has the controls for running the benchmark.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current benchmark:</strong> N/A: This shows the current benchmark name that is running.</li>
    <li><strong>Run it</strong>: Here you can set how many times the benchmark should run in succession.</li>
    <li><strong>Delay between runs</strong>: The amount of seconds to delay between runs when you selected multiple runs
        via the **Run it** field.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Upload results anonymously to elpida website</strong>: When checked and the benchmarks are finished, the
        results will be uploaded to elpida public website to be counted to statistics for this CPU.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Open result in browser after upload</strong>: If chosen to upload the results, after upload completes
        the result will be opened in your default browser in the public page of the first result of the batch that was
        run.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Generate HTML report when complete</strong>: When checked and the benchmarks are complete, an HTML
        report will be generated on disk with the results and statistics. Also, the HTML page will open in your default
        browser after generated.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Start</strong>: This button will start the benchmarking. When the benchmarks run, this button will
        change to **Cancel**, where clicking it will cancel the current benchmark execution.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Estimated execution time</strong>: The amount of time the benchmark will take to complete. This changes
        depending on the amount of **Run it** and **Delay between runs** you set.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Results history</h2>
<p>
    This contains the results of runs you performed during this session. Each line is expandable and shows the individual
    benchmark results as well as the delta with the previous execution.
