    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        Elpida is an open source benchmarking framework for building and running algorithm/program benchmarks. The default
        program built by it is the Elpida benchmark which benchmarks Cpus with a variety of benchmarks to measure the relative
        speed.

    <h2>Notice about the units Elpida uses</h2>
    <p>
        In general, Elpida uses the SI units for every metric. The only exception in this is the Bytes where the IEC units are used.
